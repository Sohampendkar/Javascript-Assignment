        <h2 >C#</h2>
        <p>The C# programming language was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Visual Studio, both of which were closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products.</p>
        <h2>LINQ</h2>
        <p>LINQ extends the language by the addition of query expressions, which are akin to SQL statements, and can be used to conveniently extract and process data from arrays, enumerable classes, XML documents, relational databases, and third-party data sources.</p>
        <h2>jQuery UI</h2>
        <p>jQuery UI is a collection of GUI widgets, animated visual effects, and themes implemented with jQuery (a JavaScript library), Cascading Style Sheets, and HTML. Using the Shodan search engine query term cpe:"cpe:/a:jquery/jquery_ui" we can determine that jQuery UI is used on approximately 800k web sites. Pinterest, PayPal, IMDb, The Huffington Post, and Netflix are utilizing the library.</p>
